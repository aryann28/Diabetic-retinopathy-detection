# Diabetic-retinopathy-detection
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults worldwide. Early detection and treatment of DR can prevent vision loss and improve patient outcomes. In this project, we aimed to develop a data visualization tool for the detection of DR using fundus images.
## Abstract
The aim of this research is to develop an effective method for detecting diabetic retinopathy. The proposed approach uses advanced image analysis techniques to analyze retinal images and identify the presence of diabetic retinopathy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using a large dataset of retinal images and compared with existing methods. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
